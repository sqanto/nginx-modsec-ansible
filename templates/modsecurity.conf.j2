#
# -- [[ Recommended Base Configuration ]] ------------------------------------------------- 
#
# The configuration directives/settings in this file are used to control
# the OWASP ModSecurity CRS. These settings do **NOT** configure the main
# ModSecurity settings such as:
# 
# - SecRuleEngine
# - SecRequestBodyAccess
# - SecAuditEngine

#
# You should use the modsecurity.conf-recommended file that comes with the

#
# -- [[ Rule Version ]] -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Rule version data is added to the "Producer" line of Section H of the Audit log:

# - Producer: ModSecurity for Apache/2.7.0-rc1 (http://www.modsecurity.org/); OWASP_CRS/2.2.4.

#
# -- [[ Modes of Operation: Self-Contained vs. Collaborative Detection ]] -----------------
#
# Each detection rule uses the "block" action which will inherit the SecDefaultAction
# specified below.  Your settings here will determine which mode of operation you use.
#
# -- [[ Self-Contained Mode ]] --
# Rules inherit the "deny" disruptive action.  The first rule that matches will block.
#
# -- [[ Collaborative Detection Mode ]] --
# This is a "delayed blocking" mode of operation where each matching rule will inherit
# the "pass" action and will only contribute to anomaly scores.  Transactional blocking
# can be applied 
#
# -- [[ Alert Logging Control ]] --
# You have three options -
#
# - To log to both the Apache error_log and ModSecurity audit_log file use: "log"
# - To log *only* to the ModSecurity audit_log file use: "nolog,auditlog"
# - To log *only* to the Apache error_log file use: "log,noauditlog"

# -- [[ Collaborative Detection Severity Levels ]] ----------------------------------------
#
# These are the default scoring points for each severity level.  You may
# adjust these to you liking.  These settings will be used in macro expansion
# in the rules to increment the anomaly scores when rules match.
#
# These are the default Severity ratings (with anomaly scores) of the individual rules -
#
#    - 2: Critical - Anomaly Score of 5.
#         Is the highest severity level possible without correlation.  It is
#         normally generated by the web attack rules (40 level files).
#    - 3: Error - Anomaly Score of 4.
#         Is generated mostly from outbound leakage rules (50 level files).
#    - 4: Warning - Anomaly Score of 3.
#         Is generated by malicious client rules (35 level files).
#    - 5: Notice - Anomaly Score of 2.
#         Is generated by the Protocol policy and anomaly files.

# would prefer.  If set to "5" it will work similarly to previous Mod CRS rules
# and will create an event in the error_log file if there are any rules that
# match.  If you would like to lessen the number of events generated in the 
# error_log file, you should increase the anomaly score threshold to something

# application layer attacks.

# TODO Many automation programs use non standard HTTP requests. While you may 
#      want to allow some of those, try not to create exceptions only for the
#      automated program based on properties such as their source IP address or
#      the URL they access.
#

# [ SQL Injection Character Anomaly Usage ]

# These rules attempted to gauge when there is an exccesive use of
# meta-characters within a single parameter payload.
#
# The most likely false positive instances will be free-form text fields.
# Adjust the the @ge operator value appropriately for your site.  Increasing
# the score will reduce false positives but may also decrease detection of

#    what they think was a mistake made by the programmer/template designer.
#
#  - Browsers are flexible when it comes to what they accept as separator between
#    tag names and attributes. The following is commonly used in payloads: <img/src=...
#    A better example: <BODY onload!#$%&amp;()*~+-_.,:;?@[/|\]^=alert("XSS")>
#
#  - Grave accents are sometimes used as an evasion technique (as a replacement for quotes),
#    but I don't believe we need to look for quotes anywhere.
#
#  - Links do not have to be fully qualified. For example, the following works:
#    <script src="//ha.ckers.org/.j">

# The trojan access detection rules detects access to known Trojans already 
# installed on a server. Uploading of Trojans is part of the Anti-Virus rules 
# and uses external Anti Virus program when uploading files.
#
# Detection of Trojans access is especially important in a hosting environment
# where the actual Trojan upload may be done through valid methods and not
# through hacking.
# --
# 
# NOTE Trojans detection is based on checking elements controlled by the client. 
#      A determined attacked can bypass those checks. We are working on 
#      enchaining the checks so it would require a major change in the Trojan
#      to overcome.
#      
# NOTE We found out that Trojan horses are not detected easily by Anti-Virus 
#      software when uploading as the signature set of AV software is not tuned
#      for this purpose. We are working on adding signature tuned to detect
#      Trojans upload to file uploading inspection.
